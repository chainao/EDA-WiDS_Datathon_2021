# WiDS Datathon 2021 - EDA

It is an **Exploratory Data Analysis** of the dataset provided by the WiDS Datathon 2021. In the visualization, I applied some lessons I learned by reading the book  "**<a href="https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/books">Storytelling with Data</a>**" written by Cole Knaflic  (*if you hadn't read it. I recommend it!!*). Before initializing our analysis, I briefly present the WiDS and the WiDS Datathon 2021. Let's go!?!

PS: there are two versions, one in Portuguese and another in English.
